# Undergraduate
As an undergrad, I worked on phylogeny inference on Southeast Asian plant species and annotating viral sequnce in bacterial genomes with the [Secor Lab](https://patsecor.wixsite.com/mysite-1). I became very interested in the wacky world of viruses and viral annotation.

# Graduate
As a (newly minted) graduate student, I hope to develop techniques to better facilitate viruses in metagenomic sequences.

# Publications
Co-author on a review article titled ["Pf Bacteriophage and Their Impact on Pseudomonas Virulence, Mammalian Immunity, and Chronic Infections"](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00244/full) (Front. Immunol., 2020)
