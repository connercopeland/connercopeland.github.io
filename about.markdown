# About Me
A lifelong resident of Western Montana, I grew up in the small town of Florence. I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Montana, where I became a member of the [Wheeler Lab](www.wheelerlab.org). I enjoyed research in Computational Biology and decided to pursue a graduate degree at UMT; in September 2020, I became a PhD student in UMT's CMMB program.

I love computer science, biology, history, and cooking! I've also been known to drag myself up the odd mountain on occasion.
